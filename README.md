# Unity & Vuforia Development Branch
This branch is the implementation of ```AR activity```. The works are done in [Unity](https://unity.com/) utilizing [Vuforia](https://developer.vuforia.com/) engine. The functions are mainly achieved by [virtual button](https://library.vuforia.com/content/vuforia-library/en/articles/Solution/How-To-Implement-Virtual-Buttons.html), which is a build-in feature in ```Vuforia``` engine.
